        In attempt to find a non-violent alternative for reducing Hell's overpopulation, 
        the daughter of Lucifer opens a rehabilitation hotel that offers a group of misfit demons a chance at redemption.

        Hazbin Hotel is institution owned by Charlie, the princess of Hell, as she pursues her seemingly impossible goal of rehabilitating demons to 
        peacefully reduce overpopulation in her kingdom. 
        She opens a hotel in hopes that patients will be "checking out" into Heaven. 
        While most of Hell mocks her goal, her devoted partner Vaggie, and their first test subject, 
        adult film-star Angel Dust, stick by her side. When a powerful entity known as the "Radio Demon" 
        reaches out to Charlie to assist in her endeavors, her crazy dream is given a chance to become a reality.
